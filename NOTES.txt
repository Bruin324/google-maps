    modal closes and marker goes away


need to separate out my services and reducers and actions
- how to link multple reducer files in provider???

set up for all api calls

probably going to need to stick marker specs from google marker onto object in props for identification and retrieval. 

clean up unnecessary actions after api is in and login/register are good.
